# About

# Developing

## Installing

* Make sure you have a new(ish) version of Node.js installed (10.x or newer), and that you have working `npm` in your commandline.
* Run `npm install` in the root folder of the project

## Running Development Watch task

Run `npm start` to start the watch task. This will build the project, start the watch tasks that wait for file changes, and open the project in your default browser.
From here, you can make edits to the templates, scripts and styles in the `/src/` folder, and the project will automatically refresh with your changes.

If you want to contribute to Old English Online, you can.

4. Click the 'Clone or download' button to clone the project to your own machine.

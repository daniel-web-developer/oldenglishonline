            <h2>Prefixes</h2>
            <p><span class="initial-letter darkorange-text">O</span>ne characteristic feature of Old English verbs is
                the extensive use of
                prefixes added to a base verb in order to change its meaning. This is still seen in modern English.
                For example, in verbs like 'undo', the prefix <strong>un-</strong> has altered the
                meaning of the verb 'do'. This is the same for many verbs ('unlock', 'uncouple',
                'unfasten', and so on), and it is certainly not the only prefix. Look at the table below: you should be
                able to work out what
                the common meaning of the prefix is in each case.

        <p>In Old English there are some regularly used prefixes that are recognisable from their modern day
            descendants, but there are also
            some that are less familiar. For example, we might recognise the term <em>forberan</em> (meaning forbear, or
            endure), but Old English
            also has '<em>geberan - to bring forth/support </em>', '<em>aberan - to endure or to bear away</em>', and
            '<em>forþberan - to bear forth</em>'.
            Below is a table of some of the most common verbal prefixes and their meanings.

        <p>As well as modifying verbs, prefixes are often added to nouns with a smiliar effect. So, the noun
            <em>un-weder</em> means 'bad weather'
            and the noun <em>utscytan</em> (from <em>scyt - defacate</em> + prefix 'ut') gives a very descriptive noun
            for diarrhoea.
            One thing to bear in mind with the prefix <strong>ge-</strong>, which you've already come across in the past
            participles section of this
            module, is that it has a similar 'perfective' effect when placed in front of the participle - in the sense
            that it indicates a completed
            action - so the past participle of '<em>hieran - to hear</em>' may be written as <em>hiered - heard</em>, or
            as <em>gehiered</em>, with
            the prefix <strong>ge-</strong> reinforcing its completedness.</p>

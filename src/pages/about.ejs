			<h2 class="darkorange-text">What is this website?</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="darkorange-text initial-letter">O</span>ld English Online was originally
				designed by Victoria Koivisto-Kokko at University College Cork as part of her Master’s
				thesis in 2018. The project was funded by UCC through the 
				National Forum’s 'Developing Disciplinary Excellence in Learning,
				Teaching and Assessment' fund from November 2019 to November 2020, during which time the core content was completed 
				by both Victoria and Dr. Tom Birkett. You can find a list of
				updates in the <a href="patchnotes.html" class="darkorange-text">patch notes</a>.
			</p>
			<h2 class="darkorange-text">How does it work?</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="darkorange-text initial-letter">T</span>he website is structured so that major
				grammatical concepts are covered in an individual module, which is subdivided into
				topics. Topics contain textual information accompanied by graphic organisers and interactive
				fill-in-the-blank questions which provide explanatory feedback. Questions are either drawn
				directly from, or inspired by, the corpus of Old English literature, and the environment is
				specifically designed to require the minimum amount of cognitive processing. In the overview
				topic of each module you can test your new vocabulary using a flashcard
				test, and you can download a pdf version of the module content which also contains a
				glossary of the Old English words used in the module.
			</p>
			<h2 class="darkorange-text">Can you see my answers?</h2>
			<p><span class="initial-letter darkorange-text">N</span>ope! The tool runs exclusively in the browser so
				anything you do on the
				website can not be seen by anyone except you. The only data we collect is page hits to see what parts of
				the site people are using.</p>
			<h2 class="darkorange-text">Can I use the website offline?</h2>
			<p>
				Yes! To do this, go to the repository [<a href="https://github.com/vkkokko/oldenglishonline" class="darkorange-text">here</a>]. Click the green <strong>Code</strong> button, and choose <strong>download a zip</strong>. To access the home page, open the Docs folder and index.html.

			<h2 class="darkorange-text">How do I report bugs or errors?</h2>

				hesitate to email them in to <span class="darkorange-text">contact@oldenglish.info</span>.

				English Online was originally designed and developed by Victoria
				Koivisto-Kokko at University College Cork as part of her
				Master’s thesis in 2018. The primary aim of the research was to
				test cognitive theories of learning online and ascertain the
				optimal design for an online course aimed at teaching medieval
				languages. Using Old English as the core subject, a course
				design and environmental design were researched using a
				combination of faculty interviews, persona testing, and research
				on cognitive theories of learning. With this information, a
				prototype of this website was built and tested using group
				comparison testing and after-scenario questionnaires.

			<h2 class="darkorange-text">Is it still being developed?</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="darkorange-text initial-letter strong">Y</span>es!
				While the MA is over, the project continues to be developed and
				streamlined. You can find a list of updates in the
				<a href="patchnotes.html" class="darkorange-text">patch notes</a
				>.
			</p>
			<h2 class="darkorange-text">How does it work?</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="darkorange-text initial-letter strong">T</span>he
				website is structured so that major grammatical concepts are
				covered in an individual module, which is subdivided into
				topics. Topics contain textual information accompanied by
				graphic organisers and interactive fill-in-the-blank questions
				which provide explanatory feedback. Questions are either drawn
				directly from, or inspired by, the corpus of Old English
				literature, and the environment is specifically designed to
				require the minimum amount of cognitive processing. In the
				overview topic of each module, you can download a pdf version of
				the module content which also contains a glossary of the Old
				English words used in the module.
			</p>
			<h2 class="darkorange-text">How much content is there?</h2>
			<p>
				<span class="darkorange-text initial-letter strong">A</span>
				list of the modules can be found on the
				<a href="courseindex.html" class="darkorange-text">Index</a>
				page. Currently, only the first three modules ‘Cases and Strong
				Masculine Nouns’, 'Weak Verbs' and 'Strong Neuter and Feminine
				Nouns' are populated. However, this project is still in
				development with new modules being added as soon as they are
				completed. As the project is still very much a work in progress,
				if you feel there is something which could be improved then
				please do not hesitate to provide feedback using the email in
				the footer.

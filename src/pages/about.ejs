					<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
					<h2 class="darkorange-text">What is this website?</h2>
					<p>
						<span class="darkorange-text initial-letter">O</span>ld English Online 
						is a website designed to 
						help users learn to read Old English.
						It was funded by University College Cork through the
						National Forum’s 'Developing Disciplinary Excellence in Learning,
						Teaching and Assessment' fund from November 2019 to November 2020, during which time the core
						content was completed by both Victoria Koivisto-Kokko and Dr. Tom Birkett. You can find a list of
						updates in the <a href="patchnotes.html" class="darkorange-text">patch notes</a>. The project was originally 
						designed by Victoria at University College Cork as part of her Master’s thesis in 2018.
					</p>
					<h2 class="darkorange-text">How does it work?</h2>
					<p>
						<span class="darkorange-text initial-letter">T</span>he website is structured so that major
						grammatical concepts are covered in an individual module, which is subdivided into
						topics. Topics contain textual information accompanied by graphic organisers and interactive
						fill-in-the-blank questions which provide explanatory feedback. Questions are either drawn
						directly from, or inspired by, the corpus of Old English literature, and the environment is
						specifically designed to require the minimum amount of cognitive processing. In the overview
						topic of each module you can test your new vocabulary using a flashcard
						test, and you can download a pdf version of the module content which also contains a
						glossary of the Old English words used in the module. Specific modules also prompt you to 
						attempt to read a basic excerpt from an Old English text that exemplifies the grammatical topic
						being discussed.
					</p>
					<h2 class="darkorange-text">Can you see my answers?</h2>
					<p><span class="initial-letter darkorange-text">N</span>o. The tool runs exclusively in the
						browser so
						anything you do on the
						website can not be seen by anyone except you. The only data collected is page hits to see what
						parts of the site people are using.</p>
					<h2 class="darkorange-text">Can I use the website offline?</h2>
					<p>
						<span class="darkorange-text initial-letter">Y</span>es! To do this, go to the repository [<a
							href="https://github.com/vkkokko/oldenglishonline" class="darkorange-text">here</a>]. Click
						the green <strong>Code</strong> button, and choose <strong>Download ZIP</strong>. To access the
						home page, unzip the <em>oldenglishonline-master</em> folder, open the <em>Docs</em> folder and
						<em>index.html</em>.
					</p>
					<h2 class="darkorange-text">How do I report bugs or errors?</h2>
					<p>
						<span class="darkorange-text initial-letter">I</span>f you notice any errors or bugs, please
						don't
						hesitate to email them in to <span class="darkorange-text">contact@oldenglish.info</span>.

					</p>
					<h2 class="darkorange-text">Can you add a new feature?</h2>
					<p>
						<span class="darkorange-text initial-letter">T</span>his is a living resource which is designed
						to be added to over time.
						If there is a feature you would like to see, let us know! You can find a guide on how to make an
						actionable feature request

					<h1 class="padding-top">Acknowledgements</h1>
					<p class="padding-top">This project never would have been completed without the work of all the people who generously
						donated their time to help me write, proof and test content over the last three years.
						I would like to take the time to especially thank Dr. Tom Birkett and Kristian Koivisto-Kokko 
						who collaborated
						closely with me on every step of this project, and without whose support the project never would
						have been completed.</p><p>
						To all our testers, this website would be a lot worse without you. A huge thank you Dr. Alison
						Killilea, Dr. Niamh Kehoe, Dr. Patricia O'Connor, Joseph McCarthy, Marcus Smith, Rosemary Kelly, Aoife Lyall, and
						Christ Fadel. (Any remaining errors are solely my fault!)
						Thank you to everyone who emailed in pointing out errors or offering suggestions on how to improve the site.
						Lastly, I would like to thank Dr. Orla Murphy who supervised the thesis where this project was
						originally designed.</p>

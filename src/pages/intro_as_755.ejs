                    <p class="padding-top">The Anglo-Saxon Chronicles are a collection of <abbr
                            title="A record of events arranged in yearly sequence">annals</abbr> in Old English,
                        chronicling
                        historical events in early medieval England. While the earliest recorded date in the annals is
                        60BC, the original
                        manuscript was likely composed in the late 9th century during the reign of Alfred the Great (r.
                        871â€“899). However, all nine surviving versions
                        are copies of this lost original, which were updated independently in various monasteries across England.

                        Since the chronicles were maintained by people in different locations and with different
                        allegiances and interests, they do not always record the same contemporary events, and in some
                        cases they record events differently. Most copies end after 1079, only the
                        Peterborough Chronicle continues after this, ending with an unfinished entry for 1154.

                            B</strong>, also known as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle D or
                        The Worcester Chronicle. It comes from the entry for the year 755 and details the actions of
                        King Cynewulf's thanes after he is murdered.</p>

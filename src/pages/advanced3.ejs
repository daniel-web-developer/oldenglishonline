            <h2>Prefixes</h2>
            <p><span class="initial-letter darkorange-text">O</span>ne characteristic feature of Old English verbs is the extensive use of
                prefixes added to a base verb in order to change its meaning. If this sounds strange, remember that modern English does this
                as well. We have verbs like 'to undo', which means the opposite of 'to do' - the prefix <strong>un-</strong> has altered the 
                meaning of the verb - in fact, it has completely reversed the meaning. This is the same for many verbs ('unlock', 'uncouple',
                 'unfasten', and so on), and it is certainly not the only prefix. Look at the table below: you should be able to work out what 
                 the common meaning of the prefix is in each case.

            </div><p>Some of these words are inherited from Old English, and some of them are more recent coinages. Because the prefix
                has a set meaning (such as <strong>under-</strong> meaning 'not enough' or 'beneath'), new verbs can be created. There was no 
                'underselling' in early medieval England - or at least, not by that name - but the word was coined from two Old English 
                roots: the verb <em>sellan</em> and the preposition <em>under</em>. In fact, many words were prefixed with <em>under-</em> in 
                Old English, including <em>underwritan</em>, '<em>undergangan - to undergo</em>', and '<em>underberan - to support (literally, 'to bear beneath')</em>'. 

            </p>
            <p>In Old English there are some regularly used prefixes that are recognisable from their modern day descendants, but there are also
                some that are less familiar. For example, we might recognise the term <em>forberan</em> (meaning forbear, or endure), but Old English
                also has '<em>geberan - to bring forth/support </em>', '<em>aberan - to endure or to bear away</em>', and '<em>forþberan - to bear forth</em>'. 
                Below is a table of some of the most common verbal prefixes and their meanings.

                <p>As well as modifying verbs, prefixes are often added to nouns with a smiliar effect. So, the noun <em>un-weder</em> means 'bad weather'
                and the noun <em>utscytan</em> (from <em>scyt - defacate</em> + suffix 'ut') gives us a very descriptive noun for diarrhoea! 
                One thing to bear in mind with the prefix <strong>ge-</strong>, which you've already come across in the past participles section of this 
                module, is that it has a similar 'perfective' effect when placed in front of the participle - in the sense that it indicates a completed
                action - so the past participle of '<em>slean - to slay</em>' may be written as <em>slegen - heard</em>, or as <em>geslegen</em>, with 
                the prefix <strong>ge-</strong> reinforcing its completedness.</p>

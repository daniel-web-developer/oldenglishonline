            <h2>Additional Verb Forms Overview</h2>
            <p><span class="initial-letter darkorange-text">I</span>n this module you've gained a more complete picture of Old English
                verbs, as well as their relationship to modern English. We may not have an inflected infinitive any more, but our present
                and past participles can be mapped onto their Old English ancestors which were used in some of the same ways, our modal 
                verbs are directly descended from Old English forms, and  
                many prefixed verbs - from unlock, to outlie - can be seen to have evolved from Old English prefixed verbs.</p>
            <h3>Modal Auxiliaries</h3>
            <p>Modal Auxiliaires are a particular class of auxiliary (or 'helping') verb that is used to express necessity, possibility, 
                intention, permission, or ability. They are mostly preterite present verbs, and in many cases both their past and present form 
                can be recognised in modern English modals such as 'can' and 'could', 'shall' and 'should', and 'will' and 'would'. Often,
                the verb they 'help' goes to the end of the sentence, as in '<em>Ic can eow stæfcræft læran - I can teach you grammar</em>'.

            <h3>Inflected Infinitive</h3>
            <p>The inflected infinitive is a form of the infinitive following the preposition 'to' and ending in <strong>-enne</strong>, and
            it can usually be translated as 'in order to [plus infinitive]'. If it follows the verb 'to be' is usually best translated with
            a verb of oblication such as 'must', 'should', or 'ought' to. The wedding vows 'to have and to hold' would be <em>to hæbbenne ond to
                healdenne'.
            </em></p>

            <h3>Participles</h3>
            <p>Participles are verb forms that are defined by their use as adjectives, but that are also used frequently in the formation of
                verbal constructions such as auixilliary + participle, or 'to be' + participle. Old English didn't have as complex a tense 
                system as modern English (in fact, it really only had past and present forms), but we still find constructions such as '<em>fered 
                hæfþ - have travelled</em>' and '<em>wæs getimbrod - was built</em>'. An example of this is '<em>Ierico wæs mid seofon weallum getimbrod
                    - Jericho was built with seven walls
                </em>'

            </div>
            <p>In Old English the present participle is usually formed with the addition of <strong>-ende</strong> to the root of the verb,
            and the past participle is usually formed with the addition of <strong>-ed</strong> or <strong>-od</strong> and sometimes with the 
            addition of the prefix <strong>ge-</strong>. There are some exceptions, as there are in modern English - so the past participle of
            <em>gan - to go</em> is <strong>(ge)gan</strong>, and strong verbs usually have an further vowel change to signal the past participle.
            </p>
            <p>A final thing to note with participles, is that when they function as adjectives modifying nouns, they take endings just like
                any other adjective. The example below 'mid þæm singendan biscope' - 'with the the singing bishop', in which the present participle
                <em>singende</em> takes the weak adjective ending <strong>-an</strong>.

            <h3>Prefixes</h3>
            <p>Commonly recognised prefixes are used in both modern and Old English to alter the meaning of a base verb in regular ways.
                So, <strong>un-</strong> is used in modern English in much the same way as <strong>on-</strong> was used in Old English - to reverse the meaning of the verb
                it is attached to. This is one way of forming 'new' verbs as well: the verb 'unfriend' uses two Old English roots, but is 
                only attested in the later medieval period: 'unfriend' in the Facebook sense is repurposing a very old term!
            </p>
            <p>Some important prefixes to look out for are <strong>ge-</strong> which intensifies or perfects (emphasises completion of) the 
            action; <strong>be-</strong> which means 'around' or 'about'; and <strong>to-</strong> which often carries the meaning 'break apart'. For example, <em>springan</em> means 'to spring', but <em>tospringan</em> means 'to spring apart or crack', as in this remedy for chapped hands
            '<em>To þæm handum ðæt flæsc tospringaþ - (literally) for hands on which flesh cracks open</em>'.</p>

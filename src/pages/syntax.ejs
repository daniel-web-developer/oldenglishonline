            <h2>The Basics of Syntax</h2>
            <p><span class="initial-letter darkorange-text">I</span>f grammar is defined as a set of rules governing how
                a language works, then syntax is
                the branch specifically dealing with the arrangement of words to form clauses and sentences. While Old
                English
                word order often follows the same patterns found in modern English, there are exceptions to this. There
                are also a
                number of rules and conventions that differ between prose and poetry that you need to be aware of to
                understand
                the texts.</p>


            <h3>Word Order</h3>
            <p>Word Order is more flexible in Old English than in modern English, but it is still generally governed by
                a set of rules which are often different to those found in modern English. For example, in modern
                English we would never say 'he him gave a dog', however it is common for an object pronoun to come
                directly after the subject. For example, '<em>He him geaf hund - he gave him a dog</em>'.
            </p>
            <h3>Old English Prose Style</h3>
            <p>There are several features of Old English sentences that makes
                them feel a little alien even when we recognise the individual clauses. For
                example, Old English often drops subject pronouns since it can be infered by the conjugation of the inital verb. 
                Old English also makes more frequent use of the conjunction '<em>ond -
                    and</em>' to join clauses and make very long sentences, which looks awkward to modern English readers.
                </p>
            <h3>Old English Poetic Convention</h3>
            <p>Like modern poetry, Old English poetry often followed unfamiliar conventions and employed rhetorical
                devices that make it hard to understand for modern English readers. For example, Old English poetry 
                was alliterative and it was common for
                poets to change word order to fit alliteration, and create compound words known as 'kennings' 
                which use figurative language in place of a more concrete single-word noun.
                For example, referring to a river as a '<em>swanrad - swan road</em>' or the sun as '<em>heofones gim -
                    heaven's gem</em>'.</p>

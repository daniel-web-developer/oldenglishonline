            <h2>Poetic Convention</h2>
            <p><span class="initial-letter darkorange-text">A</span>lmost all surviving Old English poetry is
                alliterative, meaning it creates rhythm using a pattern of
                stressed syllables that begin with the same consonant cluster.
                To adhere to the alliteration and meter, word order is often more fluid in poetry compared to prose.
                Old English poetry also employs a number of rhetorical
                devices such as <strong>lenition</strong>: poetic understatement; <strong>appositives</strong>:
                repitition of identity using a different phrase;
                and <strong>kennings</strong>: compound words which use figurative language to describe an object.
                These can make sentence structures confusing if you are unfamiliar with them so we will cover them here.
            </p>
            <p>
                Though Old English poetry is written identically to prose in manuscripts, with long run on sentences,
                editors often break poetry into lines and half-lines to make it easier for a modern reader - who is
                unfamiliar with the meter - to understand. So while the opening to Beowulf looks like this in the
                manuscript:
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">
                <img alt="The beginning of Beowulf"
                    src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cc/A_portion_of_the_Beowulf_manuscript.png">
            </div>
            <p class="padding-top">Modern editions of the poem often break up the text to look like this:</p>
            <div class="text-center">
                <div class="grammar-box darkgrey-bg">
                    <div class="inline-block text-justify">
                        <span class="white-text big-text">Hw&aelig;t we Gardena <span class="caesura">&nbsp;</span>in
                            gear dagum<br>
                            þeod cyninga<span class="caesura">&nbsp;</span>þrym gefrunon<br>
                            hu þa aðelingas<span class="caesura">&nbsp;</span>ellen fremedon</span>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                To understand why, we need to examine the meter of Old English verse. It is important to remember that
                Old English poetry is generally agreed to be composed for oral recitation, rather than simply to be
                read.
            </p>
            <h3>Alliteration and Stress</h3>
            <p>
                Alliteration is the repetition of a consonant sound at the beginning of a syllable.
                A line of poetry in Old English consists of two half-lines and each half-line has two stressed
                syllables. One
                of the two stressed syllables in the first half line always alliterates with the first stress of the
                second half line which creates a natural pause known as a <strong>caesura</strong>. For example,
                in the line: '<em>Oft him anhaga are gebideð - Often the loner finds grace for himself</em>',
                '<em>anhaga - loner</em>' alliterates with '<em>are - grace</em>' and there is a short pause between
                them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alliteration is based on sound, not letter, so consonant clusters always alliterate only with
                themselves.
                For example, '<strong>sp-</strong>', '<strong>st-</strong>'
                or '<strong>sc-</strong>' alliterates only
                with another syllable beginning with '<strong>sp-</strong>', '<strong>st-</strong>'
                or '<strong>sc-</strong>'. They do not alliterate with each other or other words beginning with
                '<strong>s-</strong>'.
                Unaccented syllables are irrelevant to the metrical pattern.
            </p>
            <h3>Kennings and Appositives</h3>
            <p>Kennings are compound words used in place of nouns. For example, referring to blood as '<em>heaþoswata -
                    battle sweat</em>'
                or referring to the sky as '<em>heofones hwealf - heaven's vault</em>'. By substituting nouns with more
                figurative language, poets increased the number of words that could be used to alliterate. 
                Also, the fact they are compound words lends itself to the rhythms of Old English meter.
            </p>
            <p>

                Appositives are the repitition of 


                "Him se yldesta andswarode,
                werodes wisa, word-hord onleac. ( To him the senior one answered, leader if the troop,
                unlocked his word-hoard.)
                (258-9)

                The phrases 'the senior one' and 'leader of the troop' both refer to
                Beowulf and stand in a relationship of variation, even though they
                happen to be separated by the first verb. :Answered' is similarly
                varied by 'unlocked his word-hoard', though the first is a simple
                verb and the second consists of object + verb. "
            </p>
            <h3>Litotes </h3>
            <p>Litotes is ironic understatement used to emphasize a point by stating a negative.
                For example, referring to a monster-filled swamp as 'Nis þæt heoru stow - That is no happy place'

                næs séo ecg fracod hilderince
                nor was that edge useless to the battle-man

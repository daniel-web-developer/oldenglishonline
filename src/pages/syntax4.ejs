            <h2>Poetic Style</h2>
            <p><span class="initial-letter darkorange-text">A</span>lmost all surviving Old English poetry is
                alliterative, meaning it creates rhythm using a pattern of
                stressed syllables that begin with the same sound.
                To adhere to the alliteration and meter, word order is often more fluid in poetry compared to prose
                and poets employ a number of rhetorical
                devices such as <strong>appositives</strong>:
                repitition of identity using a different phrase;
                and <strong>kennings</strong>: compound words which use figurative language to describe an object.
                These can make sentence structures confusing if you are unfamiliar with them so we will cover them here.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also, it is worth noting that although Old English poetry is written identically to prose in
                manuscripts,
                editors often break poetry into lines and half-lines to make it easier for a modern reader - who may be
                unfamiliar with the meter - to understand. So while the opening to Beowulf looks like this in the
                manuscript:

            <p class="padding-top">Modern editions of the poem often break up the text to look like this:</p>

            <p>
                To understand why, we need to examine the meter of Old English verse. It is important to remember that
                Old English poetry is generally agreed to be composed for oral recitation, rather than simply to be
                read.
            </p>
            <h3>Alliteration and Stress</h3>
            <p>
                Alliteration is the repetition of a sound at the beginning of a syllable and stress is
                the emphasis placed on a syllable. The primary stress generally falls on the first syllable of a word, unless it starts with a
                prefix like '<em>ge</em>', as prefixes are always unstressed.
                A line of poetry in Old English consists of two half-lines seperated by a natural pause known as a
                <strong>caesura</strong>, and each half-line has two stressed
                syllables. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The first
                heavily stressed syllable in the first half-line alliterates with the first heavily stressed syllable of
                the second half-line. Unaccented syllables are irrelevant to the metrical pattern. For example,
                in the line: '<em>Oft him anhaga are gebideð - Often the loner finds grace for himself</em>', '<em>oft - often</em>',
                '<em>anhaga - loner</em>' and '<em>are - grace</em>' alliterate and there is a short pause between
                '<em>anhaga</em>' and '<em>are</em>'.
            </p>
            <div class="text-center">

            </div>
            <p>
                As can be seen above, alliteration is based on sound, not letter.
                Vowels and diphthongs alliterate with each other. So stressed syllables
                beginning in '<strong>o</strong>', like '<em>oft</em>' can alliterate with stressed syllables beginning
                with any other vowel, like '<em>anhaga</em>'.
                However consonant clusters alliterate only with
                themselves.
                For example, '<strong>sp-</strong>', '<strong>st-</strong>'
                or '<strong>sc-</strong>' alliterate only
                with another syllable beginning with '<strong>sp-</strong>', '<strong>st-</strong>'
                or '<strong>sc-</strong>'. They do not alliterate with each other or other words beginning with
                '<strong>s-</strong>'.

                Because alliteration and meter are integral to surviving Old English verse, it can explain some
                awkward or strange sentences you run across. However, there are some other features you should be aware
                of.
            </p>
            <h3>Kennings and Appositives</h3>
            <p><strong>Kennings</strong> are compound words which use more figurative language in place of nouns. For
                example, referring to blood as
                '<em>heaþoswata -
                    battle sweat</em>'
                or referring to the sky as '<em>heofones hwealf - heaven's vault</em>'. By substituting nouns with more
                figurative language, poets increased the number of words that could be used to alliterate.
                Also, the fact they are compound words lends itself to the rhythms of Old English meter.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Appositives</strong> are nouns or noun phrases that follow or come before a noun, and specify
                who or what
                something is. For example, '<em>Him se yldesta andswarode,
                    werodes wisa, word-hord onleac - To him the senior one answered, leader of the troop,
                    unlocked his word-hoard</em>'. The phrases 'the senior one' and 'leader of the troop' both refer to
                the same subject - in this case Beowulf - even though they
                are separated by the verb. This kind of variation is a common feature of oral poetry but can
                read awkwardly to a modern English reader. You can find an example of kennings and appositives in the
                below excerpt from Beowulf: '<em>Hæfde se goda Geata leoda
                    cempan gecorone þara þe he cenoste
                    findan mihte fiftyna sum
                    sundwudu sohte secg wisade
                    lagucræftig mon landgemyrcu -
                    The worthy one had, from the Geatish peoples, chosen champions, those who were the boldest he could
                    find;
                    fifteen together, they sought the sea-wood, he led the warriors, that sea-skilled man, to the
                    boundary of the shore</em>'.

            <p>While the other rules of word order still generally apply to poetry, word order is often more fluid
                in order to conform to the stylistic features found in surviving Old English
                verse, so it is important to be aware of them.

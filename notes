                                    Sometimes conjugation produces consonant groups that are hard to pronounce.
                                    Obviously, if a word is difficult to pronounce, simplifications occur to make it
                                    easier to say. For example, if a <strong>d</strong> comes after an
                                    unvoiced consonant (c, f, h, p, s, t), it becomes a <strong>t</strong>. If the
                                    unvoiced consonant is a <strong>c</strong>, it will become an h. For example, <em>ic
                                        t&aelig;ce - I teach</em> but <em>ic t&aelig;hte - I taught</em>. When
                                    conjugation produces <strong>d√æ</strong>, it is changed to <strong>tt</strong>.
                                </p>

Pronouns are used in Old English much the same way they are in Modern English, though associated
                    verbs conjugate differently depending on number and tense. Like other nouns, personal pronouns are
                    affected by case. This will be explained in more detail in a later module, for now let's just look
                    at 3rd person masculine pronouns. Personal pronouns are one of the few things in Modern English
                    that still decline based on word function or 'case': <strong>He</strong>, <strong>Him</strong>,
                    <strong>His</strong>, <strong>They</strong>,
                    <strong>Their</strong> and <strong>Them</strong>.</p>

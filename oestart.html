            <p>While Old English is no longer spoken, understanding how to pronounce the words you read will help you remember
                them and understand the text better.</p>
            <p>Old English has no ‘silent’ letters, so you pronounce every letter in a word. In linguistic terms, “every grapheme
                is mapped onto a phoneme”. For example, the ‘c’ in cnoll — summit, is pronounced as a hard c, unlike the
                modern English equivelant ‘knoll’. The ‘e’ in here — army is pronouned making the word sound more like ‘her-eh’
                than the modern English ‘here’.</p>
            <p>Old English was first written in futhorc runes, but from the 9th century onwards it began to be transcribed into
                a Latin alphabet. The Old English alphabet is composed of 23 Latin and four ‘runic’ letters: A B C D E F
                G H I K L M N O P Q R S T V X Y Z ⁊ Ƿ Þ Ð Æ
            </p>

            <p>You’ll notice the letters U, W and J are missing in the Old English alphabet. This is because, just like in Latin,
                V was used to represent U in many words. However, unlike Latin which often uses two V in succession to represent
                W, in Old English the letter Wynn (Ƿ) is used in place of W.</p>

            <p>Just as with our modern ‘G’, ȝ can express multiple sounds and can take the place of a hard ‘g’, as in glæd —
                glad; a soft ‘g’ which sound similar to a ‘y’ as in gīet — yet, þegen ‘thane’, and weg ‘way’; and even a
                ‘zh’ sound when it appears after a ‘n’, engel — angel</p>

            <p>While ȝ will be replaced by ‘g’ in most of the practice material, it is still important to know that it exists
                and what it represents in case you ever refer directly to manuscripts.</p>

            <p>Old English letters are largely pronounced the same way we pronounce them in modern English, however, below you
                will find a list of letters unique to Old English.</p>

            <p>When found in sequence, the letters ‘sc’ are usually pronounced as ‘sh. For example, scip is pronounced ‘ship’,
                and fisc as ‘fish’. However, there are a few exceptions to this rule, for example āscian — ‘ask’ and Scottas
                — ‘Scots’.</p>
            <p>When in doubt, pronounce it like you would in modern English. So long as you remember to pronounce every letter,
                how we pronounce the word in modern English is usually a good guide on how to pronounce in Old English.</p>
